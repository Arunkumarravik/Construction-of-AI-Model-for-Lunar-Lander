# Construction-of-AI-Model-for-Lunar-Lander
This Projects mainly focus how an agent in our environment learns through many trial and error methods.

# Concepts should be aware of:
  
  Reinforcement learning Basic concepts : Bellman's concept, Markov Decision process , policies and path, active selection policies , temporal difference
  (you should have a basic idea how this concepts work.)
  Artificial Neural Networks 

# Project Workflow:

    => create an artificial Neural Network which act as the brain for our model
    => Initialize the parameters which act as the condition for training our model
    => setup the environment(Import gymnasium: open ai)
    => take an action from our initial state and store that information inside our memory 
    => take the elements like state , action , rewards , next_states and dones from our memory at each four steps and process throughout the learning
